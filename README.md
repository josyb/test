# test
I am trying to do things with myhdl

fpga25_snip4.py and test_stroby.py are the files in myHDL
test_random.v is the verilog generated file
and in test_random_corrected.v i have made some changes that make it compile.
I feel that after my changes I should re-simulate.

then there is a makefile and example-8k.pcf that declares the connection between signals and pins.
