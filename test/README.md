-blink

a simple blinking led, editing num_led you can choose how many, form 1 to 8.

-divisor

takes in input a clock and gives as output the clock divided by an integer coefficient

-pulsegen

given frequency and duration pulsegen generates a pulse that starts every frequency clock cycles, and lasts duration cycles

-shift

uses the 8 leds in the breakout board and shift a led.

-wavegen

generates as output a value ranging between min and max (linear variation over time), shows binary counter on leds

-wavepulsegen

wavegen is used to generate frequency for a pulsegen, so that frequency of pulses changes over time
